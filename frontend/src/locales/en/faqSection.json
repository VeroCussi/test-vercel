          "Resuming physical activity after childbirth is much more than just about getting in shapeâ€”itâ€™s a true gift to your body and mind.",
          "First, it helps strengthen deep muscles, particularly the perineum and abdominals, to rebuild a solid foundation and prevent discomforts such as urinary leaks or lower back pain. You'll feel stronger, more toned, and ready to take on daily challenges (including carrying your baby!).",
          "It's also a great way to boost your energy. Between short nights and busy days, moving a little can work wonders to give you an energy boost and shake off that constant fatigue.",
          "And letâ€™s not forget the mental benefits. Exercise releases endorphins, those famous happiness hormones, which help you feel better in your body and take a step back from the emotional whirlwind of postpartum life.",
